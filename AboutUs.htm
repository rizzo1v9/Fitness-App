          My name is Carlo Rizzo, and I am a graduate computer science student at SUNY New Paltz. I'm sure you've heard this before,
          but fitness changed my life. I used to be quite out of shape and it did horrible damage to my confidence and overall quality
          of life. However, as I started to learn more about fitness and diet, I am in the best shape of my life and I continue to become
          a better version of myself every day.

        <h1 class="title">Why Should I Care?</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Stepping into changing your life with fitness is quite a daunting task. There is so much to learn about what to do, what not to
          do, what to eat and what not to eat. The worst part is, you'll hear many contradicting pieces of advice and left completely
          confused on what to do. While it's true not everything works for everyone, I am here to share what worked for me, and how to 
          help you figure out what you need to do to achieve your goals through both diet and training.

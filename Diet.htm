        <h1 class="title">Who Should I Listen To?</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          There is a few people on the internet that can explain this better than I ever will be able to. These people are Greg Doucette, an IFBB Pro,
          and Remmington James, a very popular Youtuber who has a great physique himself. Both of them have openly talked about how hard dieting
          is, and how people trying to diet ruin it for themselves before they even start. There is a statistic that 95% of diets fail, so the
          approach these two incredible athletes came up with was to only focus on keeping protein high, and eating under your maintenance 
          calories. Before this, almost everyone would aim for a certain amount of carbs or fat, cycle high carb and low carb day, and a whole
          bunch of other nonsense that leads to you falling off the wagon and eating crap you don't need. Along with this mindset, both of them
          focus on creating high protein, low calorie versions of food everyone loves (pizza, ice cream, etc.) and documenting it on Youtube
          for everyone to see. I believe this is a revolution in health and fitness that people from the outside are overlooking and I want
          to spread the word of how much easier this approach makes it.

        <h1 class="title">How Should I Start?</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
        <p><a href=https://tdeecalculator.net/>https://tdeecalculator.net/</a> is the first step to figuring out many calories you need
        to consume a day to maintain your weight and in turn lose it. Once you have this number, download the MyFitnessPal app on your
        phone and set it up with your data regarding your height and weight. Next, you will absolutely need a food scale so you know 
        exactly what you're putting into your body so you can track it and know how many calories you've consumed each day. </p>

        <p>As stated in the diet page, there is a lot of great information out there and a lot of fake nonsense that is made to get
          views on Youtube, or sell a product. It is quite daunting to look at this information and try to figure out what is 
        actual advice and what is a product placement. One website that I personally swear by and that has never let me down is
        <a href=https://www.bodybuilding.com/>https://www.bodybuilding.com/</a>. One thing I love about this site is that it has been around
      since essentially the start of commercial internet, and they site actual studies that are conducted regarding supplements and training. </p>

          <h1 class="title">How Should I Start?</h1>
          <h2 class="subtitle">
          <p>For an absolute beginner, I would highly reccomend <a href=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/wotw52.htm> Bodybuilding.com's 3x5 
            program</a> along with <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJlFmxiL11s&ab_channel=Bodybuilding.com> Bodybuilding.com's
            at home core workout</a>. These two programs in combination with each other will help you hit your chest, triceps, shoulders,
            legs, biceps, back and core, which is essentially every major muscle group you should be looking to hit. These are both easy to
            follow for beginners also, although the core workout requires some balance that people new to working out might not have yet.
